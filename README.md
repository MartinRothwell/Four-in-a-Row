# Four-in-a-Row
Console based Connect Four type game.

How to Play:
  The game starts by prompting the player to choose how many connections will be required to win the game. So, to play an ordinary
    Connect Four game, the player would enter a 4 and press enter.
  Then the game asks which column the player would like to move to. As is usual for Programs, Use the columns as if they are part
    of an array, with the 1st column being spot zero. 
  The computer will then randomly select a column for the opponent's turn.
  The first player to the number of wins that was input at the beginning wins!
